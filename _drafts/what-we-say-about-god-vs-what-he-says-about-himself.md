Lately I've been thinking alot about challenges to the things we say about God. Specifically, I've been allowing the challenges that others have with the things we say about God drive me to challenge those things myself.

The thing I'm really interested in challenging is what we say about God in relation to what he says about Himself, and finding where there are discrepancies we need to resolve. Or in other words, where are we getting it wrong?

Adherants to orthodox Christianity (myself included) have long believed that orthodox Christianity has everything right about God. If you stay from that orthodoxy, you are getting into the lines of heresy, or being wrong about God.

The basic justification for this ideology goes something like this:

Long ago, God chose a people group from among all peoples - the Hebrews - to reveal Himself to mankind. He spoke to prophets who recorded His revelation about Himself in written form as Scripture. God's revelation about Himself included the fact that at some point He was going to reconcile all people to Himself through the Greatest Prophet, who would actually be God taking on the form of mankind.

Eventually, Jesus shows up on the scene in Jewish history claiming to be that Prophet (also known as "the Sent One", "Messian", or "Christ") and validating that claim by doing things no human could do - healing the sick, raising the dead, and other miraculous works. Eventually he is rejected by the Jewish religious leaders because he poses a threat to their established religious order, and they kill him by having him crucified under a torturous Roman punishment of hanging on a cross until suffocated.

Three days after being killed on the cross, however, Jesus rises from the dead, appearing to his followers over the next 40 days and proving that he truly was who he claimed to be: God in the flesh. At the end of the 40 days Jesus ascends directly into heaven, but before he does he comissions his followers to continue his work on earth and spread the message about who he is and what he came to do - reconcile man to God.

His followers (also known as "disciples", or "apostles" when referring specifically to his 12 closest disciples) went on throughout their lives to spread the message of Jesus throughout their known world, pastoring entire cities of new Jesus followers, and ultimately giving their own lives for Jesus under persecution for being Jesus followers.

Now a few centuries had passed when the Jesus message had become much more accepted throughout the known world, and "Christianity" was actually a thing. The Church was no longer just a group of people who claimed faith in Jesus, but had now become and official organization complete with a leader - the Pope. There was even a special council established to determine what literature was offically accepted as authoritative "Scripture". And from that time forward we have been pointing back to those events as the foundation of Orthodox Christianity.

Fast forward to today, when the message of Jesus (also known as "The Gospel") is readily available and been spread throughout most of the world. There are places on earth where following Jesus is freely permissible and encouraged, and places where it is literally banned by law and those found to be practicing faith in Jesus suffer horrible persecution for their faith.

There are places where you can find groups of people who adhere to the basic tenants of what Jesus preached and modeled but without claiming to belong to any specific religion, and there are groups of people who claim to live under the banner of "Christianity" who bear very little resemblance to what we find written about the life of Jesus and those who followed him.

The latter is what has come to seriously disturb me in my adulthood.

I've grown up within the body of religion known as "Christianity". Raised by parents who were commited to living life after the example of Jesus, and being around...
