I often meet people who are new into the design industry, or have been doing print design for a while and want to transition into web design. The question I am often asked is, “where do I start?” It’s truly a good question.

I can only answer from my own experience, and from some of the things I’ve learned over the years to be best practices in our industry. So that’s what I’m going to share with you.

[I occasionally teach](http://joelglovier.com/hacc/) technology courses like Web Authoring, and others, at my local community college, and this is also some of the info I give my students who are just learning web design. You can also [check out an outline of resources](http://joelglovier.com/hacc/2011/spring/web-authoring/) from a recent Web Authoring course at HACC that I prepared for my students.

But for anyone building websites - or just designing them - it’s best to have a working knowledge of HTML and CSS as a fundamental foundation. These are two of the easiest computer languages you can learn, and they are not even programming or scripting languages. One is a markup language (meaning you markup content with semantic meaning) and the other is simply a way of writing rules for how to present your content.

If you have no clue where to start with learning HTML and CSS, you need to answer one question first: How do I best learn?

Are you a book learner? If so, check out this book by Jennifer Robins - which is actually the book that I learned all of this stuff from. It’s an excellent resources, and very well written. It will walk you through from the very beginning all the way to writing your first sites.

Are you a audio/video learner? If so, check out Lynda.com for video tutorials on HTML and CSS. They have excellent content that will also take you from the beggining.

Also you can check out this tutorial series from Net Tuts if you prefer to walk through tutorials at your own pace.

As for my typical workflow, I usually start with working through the information architecture (IA) of the site (meaning how all the content will be hierarchically arranged - also called a sitemap) and tracking with how I want (or the client wants) the user to interact with my content. The IA phase is a lot of asking questions like, “how do I want the user to interact with this content,” “What is my goal for the user, or what do I want them to do”, “What information should the user be able to find on this site”, etc.

The goal of the IA phase is to get a good handle on the strategic purpose for the site. As for tangibles, that includes a rough sitemap of what pages should exist, and how they will be linked together.

The next phase is wirefaming, where essentially I am making a rough mockup of key pages of the site, like the homepage, for what specific content will appear on those pages. It also deals with layout, but that part is usually very in flux, as it will change later. The goal of wireframing is mostly just to get a handle on what specific content should appear key pages of the site.

After wireframing is complete (which I often simply do with a pencil and paper, although many people perfer using Photoshop, or specific wireframing tools like Google Drawing, Balsamiq, etc.), then it’s time to imagine some actual design for the site. This is where I begin laying out a specific look and feel for the site in a Photoshop document.

The design phase, however, can also be a pretty fluid process. Typically I will mockup as much as is necessary in Photoshop, then begin coding and building what I have, and often return back to photoshop later to address additional design details that weren’t necessary to address yet.

And sometimes I’ll do very little in Photoshop but for the basics, and then do a bulk of the design work while working directly with code.

Either way, once I have a good handle on the design feel and basic layout, then I begin writing my HTML for the site. The HTML is the actual content of the site as ready by your browser and by search engines. It’s where you write semantically meaningful content, and apply tags to describe what your content is. This is where you need a working knowledge of HTML and modern web standards. The best practices for writing web documents have drastically evolved over the years, and it’s very important to note where the state of the web is today. Websites like alistapart.com are very helpful in tracking with current best practices, but that one in particular can be a bit heady. The best thing you can probably do is just keep your eyes peeled as you are learning to references of what are current best practices.

After I have a well written HTML document, then I begin applying the design of my site with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The CSS file is the part of your site that will give the presentation aspect to your content. For a brief intro to the power of stylesheets, check out csszengarden.com. You will see how with simply changing one stylesheet you can make your content look entirely different - without necessarily having to change your HTML markup.

This is a far cry differently from the workflow that designers and developers of old used to use when a designer created something in Photoshop, and sliced it up, and then a developer used table based markup and image elements to put it all together. The main difference is that the old school way provided no real semantic markup for search engines to understand what your site was about, and for users with accessibility issues to alternately view your content. Additionally, it made updating said sites a nightmare (trust me, I inherited one such site from a client and still have to deal with that nightmare seasonally!).

Anyway I’m sure I’ve given you much to chew on so far. Feel free to ask further questions.
