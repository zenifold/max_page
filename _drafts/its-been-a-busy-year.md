title: It's been a busy year
---

I love writing. But this year I feel like I've done far little of it compared with recent years. But there has been good reason: it's been a busy year.

I've had a lot of interesting life changes this year. Just for posterity here's some of the highlights:

- Bought our first house
- Left appendTo and started working at GitHub
- Ran a successful Kickstarter and launched Dev Tees
- Launched Remote Jobs
- Conceived our third child
- Took our first family vacation in 6 years, first ever with the kids
- Traveled to San Francisco 4 times, Denver, Pittsburgh, and Tampa

## Calming Down

Thankfully life is finally calming down. Now that I'm at GitHub I've finally stopped doing freelance work, and I'm bringing some closure to my side projects so I can have more time for family, and other creative pursuits like reading and writing.
