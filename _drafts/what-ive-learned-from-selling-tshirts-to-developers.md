So here's some of the most important takeaways I've picked up from marketing t-shirts to developers the last few years:

## Driving traffic is everything

In the experiences I've had with hocking goods on the webs, driving traffic is everything. During times when I'm doing absolutely no promotion of Dev Tees, I'll see a few sales a week on average. But when I'm driving traffic with a promotion (wether a discount code, or product giveaway, etc) sales always skyrocket. It's actually a simple and reliable principle in the world of retail, really, but one which often escapes us who live in the product world.

The reality is clothing and other gear is a non-necessity to most developers (or at least our branded merch is anyway), so if you're not putting it in front of them somehow they don't just show up at the door to buy.

Now I'm sure GitHub merch will always be in much higher demand than the much smaller merch projects I've had experience with, but the same basic principle applies. People will show up at our door to buy our .com product day in and day out because it's a part of their everyday lives and ecosystems as developers and designers. But that's not the case with merch, so we have to have a solid promotional strategy if we really want to drive sales.

## Build on promos around holidays, and other popular brands

The basic premise here is ask people to open their wallet and hand you money when they already have it open handing out money to others. I've experienced success in this route time and time again.

I've tried promos (such as 20% off coupons) at various times of year, and the most successful times by far are during holidays or events when people are already in buying mode, like Memorial Day, Labor Day, Black Friday, etc. I've seen sales skyrocket to several hundred percent of the average week during such holiday promotions.

I typicaly try to align my shop promotions with other popular brands my Dev Tees audience is buying, like United Pixelworkers and Ugmonk. I know from customer feedback that my audience has a lot of overlap with the audience of those companies, so I subscribe to their email lists (and I'm actually a customer myself), track with their promotions, and try to offer comparable promotions around the same times they do.

With this approach you tend to reach people when they are already in "buying mode", which usually means they are happier to shell out more dough for more cool stuff.

## Favor discounts over free shipping

Two reasons for this:

Discounts feel like money off of what customers are really trying to buy, rather than just a reprieve of something customers don't really factor in until the end anyhow.

The cost of free shipping is often greater than the cost of discounts due to the widely variable cost of shipping (such as international prices which are exorbitant these days). So offering a percentage discount often results in less overall cost associated with the promotion in my experience - by far.

## Fulfillment is Hardâ„¢

Fulfillment, and ordering inventory, is risky business. I'm really glad to see we're outsourcing the fulfillment to Teelaunch. Fulfilling orders has been the bane of my existence since taking up hocking t-shirts.

But inventory ordering and management is also a challenge. We probably have some great data we could pull on sizes and color combos ordered (fortunately we generally offer just one color choice per shirt design, which is a really good move I wouldn't suggest deviating from) that should inform our quantities ordered going forward to minimize waste.

Or, on the other hand, we might just have enough demand to always sell through what we order - in which case that would be amazeballs. One less thing to worry about.

So those are the most important, relevant things I have to share. Hope it's helpful. I'll be sure to speak up if I have anything more to contribute as things keep moving forward. :zap:
