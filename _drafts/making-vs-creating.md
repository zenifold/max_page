{write about the difference between making stuff - ie replicating things that exist or have been already conceived vs creating stuff - ie inventing new things; also stress that a lot of times making is sufficient - ie Paul Rand’s quote, “dont’ try to be original, just try to be good”, but challenge that good is first, then you should move on to good original - ie adding something new}
