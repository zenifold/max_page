[brief: Ever met someone who when you interacted with them, you always felt like they had some sort of hidden agenda, or plans for you? This is quite common for humans, because when we are passionate about our agendas, we naturally want to get others involved. 

However, it's not what the Gospel calls Jesus followers to, and I've become convinced that the way a lot of Christians treat other people defaults to a perspective that the people around us are just a way for us to achieve our "heavenly goals". 

We need to realize that the real value in loving people is not that they will then love us back, or that they will help us accomplish something we are after, because that turns love into manipulation. The real value in loving people, is that we get to love people. And in doing so, we get to experience part of God's divine nature, because it is in His nature to selflessly, unconditionally love people. That itself is it's own reward.
