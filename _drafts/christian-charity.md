<p class="disclaimer">This post is written both for fellow Christians, and for non-Christians alike. It's not aimed at anyone really, it's just a general explanation of why I give and how I choose to give. I believe everyone, regardless of religion, should practice charitable giving and hope that my thoughts here might inspire you to do so, regardless of who you are.</p>

As a Christian, giving is profoundly central to the message of Jesus and to aligning oneself and one's life with that message. Everything that following Jesus is about is giving. Giving of yourself to God. Giving of yourself to others. Giving of your time, attention, resources, emotions, thoughts and strength to that which God calls us to give toward: those who need it.

At the heart of giving is the realization, agreement and acknowledgement that whatever I have and whatever I am is not mine to begin with, nor do I deserve it. All that I have and all that I am have been given to me, not because of something about me that makes me worthy, but because God in His generosity, grace, and eternal wisdom has given to me for His purposes.

This truth about the way the universe works inspires humility and generosity, and it's why I give. I give because it is a priviledge to give. I give because my giving benefits me just as much or more than it benefits whomever I give to. And I give because I realize that what I have is not for my sole benefit, but for the benefit of others and my benefit is in practicing that giving.

If I truly took these things to heart, I would surely give far more than I do now, and far more often. But regardless of my shortfalls in practice, giving is something I firmly believe in as fundamental to my faith.

## Being a good steward

So on to the specific type of giving where you open up your wallet and fork over cash - the financial kind.

To be clear, my afforementioned sentiments about giving not just of money but also of giving of oneself in many other forms is in no way an out for actually giving of money. It's a call to realize that you can give money and still not be generous if you are stingy with your affections, with your time, or with a host of other intangible things. But the giving of money itself too is critically important in this excercise of faith in action. And in many senses it's where the rubber meets the road because money is the objective guage of value for just about anything in our society.

Extrapolating the belief that all I have is not mine but has been given to me to use for a purpose, I hold that I'm not an owner of my money (or any other resources), but merely one who is charged with the responsibility of managing what I have and managing it well. What does it mean to manage well? It means that I must manage what I have received in a way that is in harmony with the will of the one whom I have received it from. That is, God.

It's my Christian duty to be a good manager of all of my money in all ways. That means using it to provide for the family I have been given, and for those who are in my life that I'm called to love and serve. It means using my money as a tool to accomplish God's purposes in the world: bringing healing to the hurting, wounded and sick; bringing reconcilliation to the broken and astranged; bringing truth to those who have been oppressed by lies; bringing equality and freedom to those who have been made to suffer injustice.

Sometimes using my money for those purposes looks like outright spending it for things that directly accomplish those purposes. Sometimes it looks like using my money (and other resources like time and talents) to make more money so that it might have a greater effect overall. Sometimes it means simply handing it over to people who have found a systematic way of accomplishing the missions that are aligned with God's work in the world.

But no matter how it plays out, my conviction is that I am responsible to use my money (as with all of my resources) for things that are aligned with the good news of Jesus.

## But what qualifies and what doesn't?

So how do I decide what meets those very abstract criteria in practical terms, and choose where and to whom to give my money?

Many other Christians who I respect have decided that they are only going to give money to causes or organizations that are "Christian". What they mean by that is they only want to give to organizations that have either a stated mission of spreading the message of Jesus, or are run by people who align directly with that message.

While I respect people who set that standard for their financial giving, I don't exactly share the same standard.
