<p class="disclaimer">This is my personal perspective, reflective of my own faith journey, and how I personally view the topic of being an authentic follower of Jesus in western society in the twenty first century. It is not an assertion that following Jesus does or should look like this for everyone, in all societies, at all tims in human history. While I believe that it should resonate with others who follow Jesus, and support the corporate experiences of authentic Jesus followers regardless of culture or period in history, I am not claiming this perspective is one that everyone will or should agree with. These thoughts are shared with the humility of one conveying truths he has discovered for himself, not the arrogance of one boasting a unique experience which all should strive to emulate. Notably, I'm also advocating for the fact that there is diversity in what it genuinely means and looks like to follow Jesus, depending on context and culture of those who follow.</p>

I often describe myself as a "Jesus follower." I used to use the term "Christian," but I typically avoid that term because of the cultural and political baggage associated with it which accurately reflects neither the Gospel message itself, nor my own personal convictions about what it means to follow Jesus.

While the term Christian has a warm, affectionate association for some, it has a disgusting and offensive connotation for others. The Apostle Paul said that the message of the Gospel would certainly be an offense to some (specifically speaking of those who love evil), but the offense I am referring to is not one of those who are diametrically opposed to justice, truth and love. It's the offense of people who have encountered something labeled "Christian" that is anything but Christ-like. It's the offense of people who have seen atrocities committed under the guise of "God's work", and it's the offense of people who claim to stand for a standard of divine love that is not clearly evident in their actions.

That's why I avoid the label "Christian". But what *does* it mean to be a Jesus follower?

For me, being a Jesus follower means that the epicenter everything in my life is Jesus. He is the constant that I start every hypothesis with. I filter all truth through the lenses of my belief that he *is* the truth.

It means that I yield my own ambitions and desires to his desires for me and for others. It means that accept his calling to die to my own selfish nature, and to love God and love others with a love that seeks the benefit of others beyond the benefit of myself.

It means that I have a genuine love and affection for this God who has been at work in all of humanity since the beginning of time, and that I believe the person and teachings of Jesus are the ultimate exposing of what God has been up to all along.
