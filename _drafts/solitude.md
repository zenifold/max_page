Last weekend, I went away on a personal retreat for two days. By myself. No wife, no kids, no work. Just me, a place to sleep and shower, and some stuff to read, write with, and play a bit.

My goals were to rest and relax, reflect on life and talk to God, spend time reading, write a bit, and just do time wasting things like reading Facbook, Twitter, and playing Tiny Death Star.

I stayed at a lovely Airbnb near my house where I had a bed, a private room and bath, and a place to chill. My beloved wife sent the kids to be with my parents for the weekend, and sent me away all by myself. And it was glorious.
