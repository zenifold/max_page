In my humble opinion, I think much of the reason for those statistics about why Christian young people are having sex just as much as non-Christian young people when the teaching of the Christian faith is against sex before marriage comes from the way that said teaching is expressed to our young people today.

Having grown up in the Church and gone to both Christian and public schools, I recall very vividly that most of the time these teachings were promoted with a really crappy rationale (more on that in a moment). And having been involved in youth ministry for almost a decade until I was about 25, I can affirm I saw the same crappy teaching rationale applied all the time.

The problem is that the teaching for abstinence is so often based on one or two very flawed grounds, neither of which reveals the actual biblical purpose behind reserving sex exclusively for marriage.

The first grounds is typically some type of way to make young people feel like crap about themselves before God if they are sexually active. Indeed, the Bible condemns sexual activity outside of the covenant of marriage as sin. But the point of the Christian doctrine of sin is not to make people feel like crap about themselves for what we do - it’s to make us realize our great and universal need for being saving from the destructive effects of sin, and to understand how great God’s grace is that He has paid for our sin and offers us forgiveness.

Do you see the difference? It’s the difference between telling people, “hey, you’re a piece of trash because of what you are doing in your life,” and telling them, “hey what you are doing is going to end badly for you, but God loves you wants to rescue you from that outcome.”

The other grounds that is so often used to “motivate” young people to save sex for marriage is by making them feel like crap about themselves in the eyes of other people - namely their future spouse - if/when they do have sex.

This one is just as heinous, to me, because it negates the whole perspective of the Gospel. The classic illustration that has been used is of a rose that has been passed around from person to person dozens of times. The rose has so much innate beauty, and is so lovely as it is, but after being handled time and time again it will eventually deteriorate and look like trash to be thrown away. Now who would want that rose??

The comparison of course is to a beautiful young person and how if they are “passed around” sexually from person to person, who is going to want them after all of that??! (Referring of course to how by the time they are ready to get married, why would anybody want them after they’ve been used and handled already.)

The problem here is actually the teachings of THE BIBLE. As preacher Matt Chandler says it so well, “[JESUS WANTS THE ROSE!!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgIecL1IdY)” The whole of the Gospel is about how Jesus wants us exactly as we are: handled, broken, used, worn, crapped out. And that’s the message we should be sharing with young people about sex.

It’s not that if you have sex God is not going to want you and neither is your future spouse. It’s that sex is a gift from God that he designed us for, and strongly desires that we would practice in the context of how he desired it to work: within the committed context of a lifelong marriage covenant between two people.

Any other grounds for teaching abstinence undermines the point of the Gospel and the truth that God is not after our begrudging submission, but after our lasting joy. With that perspective I believe there is a true reason to wait until marriage: the hope that such waiting will bring about the best experience for life-long sexual intimacy with your spouse.
