## Planning your project

### Crafting a successful project idea

Don't assume that just because you have an idea that it's going to be successful. And don't assume that just because you have an idea that successfully gets funded, it's going to be successful in everything that happens after your project reaches funding.

[my example from experience here]

Beyond my own experiences, I've also learned from [backing dozens](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/jag) of Kickstarters, and researching many, many more.

I've noticed that certain ideas have inherent qualities which can naturally tend to be more successful than others, and can naturally tend to have more long term success post-Kickstarter when you're not actively raising money anymore, and you're just simply trying to sell your product/run your business/live your dream.

Here's some of the qualities I've noticed about some of the most successful projects I've seen, or personally been part of as a project create or as a backer:

1. 

### Logistics

- setting your backer reward levels; remember these are essentially your price points; build in enough margin for Kickstarter and Amazon Payment fees (10%) and shipping
- planning for fulfillment
- 

## Running your campaign

## After the campaign

- tax prep (understanding how payments come through, and that you'll get a 1099-k from Amazon payments)
- 

## Keeping your backers involved

## Planning your next project

### Learning from the past 
- identify what worked and what didn't work
- make adjustments

### Work your crowd
- Get your previous backers on your side 
- get their input
- ask the to help spread the word
- ask them to consider supporting you again.
