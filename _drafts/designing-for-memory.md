[brief: based on chapter in Design of Everyday Things, talk about how people's behavior is driven by associations they've stored in their memory, and how designers need to be cognisant that what people associate is often the simplest representation, but not necessarily most accurate (coin redesign example; thermometer theory example; Newton's common sense physics, etc)]
