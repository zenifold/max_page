strangers"

Most people, whether people of faith or nonreligious people, have heard the story of the good Samaritan. Or, if they haven't heard the story, they are familiar with the expression. The term has become ubiquitous in our culture for referring to a stranger who does good to someone they do not know.

However, that version of the story is completely missing the point. Here's why, and why it matters.

According to the Gospel account of Luke, Jesus once told a story to those who were following him about a man who was traveling down the Jericho road. It was a very well known and busy thoroughfare that his audience would have been well familiar with. In this story, Jesus' main character is beaten and mugged by robbers as he travels, left with only his wounds on the side of the road. One by one people begin to pass him, opting not to assist this man who is obviously in need of medical attention. 

In Jesus' parable, the people who pass him by without doing anything are a priest (obviously a "holy" person) and a Levite (the Levites were the preistly tribe in Hebrew culture, so another very religous man to say the least). For the audience Jesus was speaking to, this part of the story may or may not have come as a surprise. In reality, for a Jewish priest to touch and assist such a wounded person would by Jewish Levitical law cause them to be considered unclean, which had very real ramifications.

The final person to pass the man is a Samaritan. The Samaritan stops to assist the man, tends to his wounds, and even takes him to an inn to rest up and recover, even paying for his stay.

Typically when this story is told, we are tempted to interpret the Samaritan as an "average Joe", assuming that the point Jesus is making is something about the average person can be more righteous than even religious leaders if they put their faith into practice in real and tangible ways like the Samaritan in the parable did. 

And we would be right, except for history.

If you know Jewish history, this will come as no suprise, but it turns out the Jews were conquered in 800BC by the Assirians, and many of the Hebrew people were taken away from their home country of Israel to Assyria and Samaria where they made new lives, built new relationships, and made the best of their circumstances. That meant they married with people from their new land, and became what we would call bi-racial.

The rest of the Jews who still remained back in Israel, of course, hated the Assyrians and Samarians. Both because they conquered Israel, and because there were many Samarians who were what they viewed as "half breed" Jews, and to them that was an abomination to God.

By the time Jesus came around, to the Israelites, the Samarians were the object of full on racist hatred. The Jews couldn't stand the thought of Samarians. 

It was not by chance that Jesus picked a Samarian to be the hero of his story. And it would be incredibly shortsighted for us to assume that there was no subversive intention behind telling the story with the Samarian being more righteous in a tangible and practical way than the religous leaders in the story. In fact, Jesus story about this "good Samaritan" most likely offended many of the people in his audience.

What the story of the good Samaritan was really about was exposing the hatred, racism, and bigotry in people's hearts. The people who heard this story for the first time were people who had a deep honor and regard for the religious leaders of their day, yet hated an entire group of people just because of their ethnic heritage. What Jesus does is come along and expose the hipocrisy of their attitude, and confront them with it.

And it's a challenge for us to, when we read it right. If we read about, or think about, or talk about the story of the good Samaritan as merely a lesson on being kind to strangers (which too is important, by the way), we are completely missing the real message that Jesus had for his original audience, and for us too. 

It's the message that all people are people of worth, and value, and deserve to be helped. All people are worth loving to the point that it costs us something. All people are created in God's image, and all people are people that we should love and honor as God's creation. Not just the people who worship like us, or look like us, or do things we do, or who believe the things we believe. 

All people.
