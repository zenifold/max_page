title: Calling stuff "Christian"
subhead: A label that befits only people, not stuff

Recently I saw a tweet about “top 10 Christian cartoons.” My first reaction was to ignore it completely. My next thought was, “why do I typically ignore stuff when it’s labeled ‘Christian’?”

I have a very good answer that has nothing to do with being ashamed of my own faith, the Gospel, or Jesus. I stand boldly for those things, but often when I see something labeled "Christian" I cringe a little bit inside.

The reason I instinctively ignore just about anything that slaps the word “Christian” before it is because I've found that typically it is a complete misuse of the word as an adjective for the noun to which it is being ascribed.

There are only a very select group of things that can appropriately be labeled “Christian”, and it does not include the following cliche religious objects:

1. “Christian” Clothing. This includes t-shirts, entire clothing lines, accessories like a “Jesus First” pin, etc.
2. “Christian” Music.
3. “Christian” Movies
4. “Christian” Concerts or Festivals (see no. 2)
5. “Christian” Cruises. Really???
6. “Christian” books (including comics or cartoons)
7. “Christian” food. One word: Testamints.
8. “Christian” companies.

## Why that word fails us

## So what DOES warrant the use of the term “Christian” as an adjective?

First of all, let’s be clear here that the word “Christian” was originally used as a noun to slander a group of people who simply called themselves followers/disciples of Jesus - or more literally to the Biblical account, followers of the “the Way.” So the origins of the term "Christian" come from describing people, not stuff.

In adjective form, the word “Christian” literally means “Christ-like,” or “little Christ.” People who did not follow Jesus actually used the term about early disciples of Jesus to mock them. But still, we see that it has a direct correlation to the aspect of being a person, and your relationship as a person to Jesus Christ (as a follower or an imitator of).

This is why I take such issue with the term “Christian” being thrown around so loosely to refer to things like clothing, music, or books.

I get what is happening here from a cultural perspective. The people who hold to values that are consistent with a Biblical model are seeking a simple way to identify things that match up with that same model. I totally get that, and I think it's a natural tendency for people to have. We naturally look for things we identify with, and ways to communicate that we identify with things.

But I think it's lazy, and it's a HUGE mistake that does a tremendous diservice to the actual message of Jesus, and those who truly need to hear it most.

When we bastardize the word "Christian" by applying it to a bunch of stuff, we are telling people this is what following Jesus is all about. And while there may be a shallow thread of connection between following Jesus and the crap that often gets ascribed as "Christian", we are polutting the actual message of Jesus by connect the idea of placing faith in him with our sentiments about material things that we think are somehow consistent with our faith.

Probably much of the time when the term “Christian” is used to refer to any of the above items it is far less noble than I'm trying to give credit for. Often it's actually just a sleezy way to market your product/service/item/event/xyz to an audience of people you know will take notice if you just slap the word "Christian" on it.

I see this all the time. People want to sell something to Christians, so they say, “I’m starting a Christian clothing company.” The motives might be legit (or not) but what they are really doing is just saying, “I want to sell clothes, and Christians are my target audience.”

## The secular and the sacred

What's just as maddening as [describe the above sentiment in summary here] is that using the term "Christian" as an adjective for things creates an artificial separation between the secular and the sacred, when a true Gospel inspired perspective on life sees all things as sacred.

*(points:)*

- There is a massive amount of cultural and political baggage associated with the term Christian. While some people have a warm, affectionate conception of what is associated with the word "Christian", others (often justifiably) have a nauseating, loathsome association with the word "Christian". While the term in itself should be quite neutral, in our culture it is anything but.

*(Conclusion paragraph)*

Whether the motives are pure, or more nefarious, using the term "Christian" to refer to anything other than people who are Jesus followers does a disservice to everybody. Let's just stop it.
