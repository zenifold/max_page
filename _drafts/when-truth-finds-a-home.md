[brief: write about how people rarely seek truth; they actually seek to affirm their existing beliefs. But in my spiritual journey seeking truth, I've found that you have to let go of your existing assumptions, challenge and question everything, and be open to the truth wherever it is, whatever it looks like, and hold fast to it.]

<p class="disclaimer">Warning: this is not one of those articles you walk away from feeling good because everything you currently believe has been affirmed. It's one of those articles where you are challenged, and possibly offended because I'm not here to make people feel good about what they already believe. I'm here to challenge you to seek the truth, and abandon everything else.</p>
