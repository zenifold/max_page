Write about how everything is sacred, and how when Jesus came, God was entering humanity in a way that brings restoration and renewal to all things. Therefore we should view all things as sacred.

Talk about the veil in the Temple being ripped, and how it not only indicated that we have direct access to God, but also that there is no longer an artificial divide between the holy and the common.

Explore other Biblical examples that support the concept of the sacredness of all things, such as Paul insisting that Christ was the rock in the desert that Moses struck for water, and other examples from Rob Bell's discussion of this similar topic in "What we talk about when we talk about God"
