Design is not a feature.

Some people treat design like it's a feature of their product. As in, "It has X, it can Y, and it's looks great!" They tack design onto the end of a feature list as though having something that is well designed is just another feature in a list of positive aspects of the product.

To be fair, that is a legit aspect of design. But it's only one aspect of design (design as a feature), and to be FULLY fair it's an incomplete perspective of design.

True design is is far more than a feature, it's about the way you approach what you are building in the first place.

It's how you look at the problems you are trying to solve, and it's about informing the solutions you are creating through what you are building. It's about seeking to gain a full and complete understanding of the problem at the core of what is being built, so that only the most effective and complete solution can be crafted, nothing more, and nothing less.

Design is far more than the aesthetic aspects of something, design is a strategy. Design is an intentional way of thinking that takes responsibility for something and proposes a solution aimed at addressing that thing.
