Pushing Ella on the swing the other day I had an epiphany. I realized how much faith I’m putting in the branch that’s holding the swing and the chains that attach it.

I’m trusting the entire life and safety of my little girl to these objects. And normally I think nothing of it. Nor would anyone else.

But today I started thinking of how many people have such a hard time with the idea of putting faith in God.
