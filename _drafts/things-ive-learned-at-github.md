For the past year I've been a designer at GitHub. I've had the priviledge of working in an amazing environment where the best idea wins, autonomy is the default, and brilliant coworkers are the rule, not the exception. I've had a chance to hone my existing skills and picked up some really amazing new lessons along the way.

Here's the highlight reel from my personal lessons learned.

## Stuff I've learned about product design

1. When given a choice between polishing a feature and adding a new feature, always choose in the interest of improving the existing user experience. Users don't care about features, they care about having great experiences. Focus on cultivating experiences with the product that make users feel happy to be using it.
2. Ship first, iterate later. Don't ship broken things, or incomplete things, but focus on shipping things, not shipping perfect things. Then learn, and iterate accordingly, and ship your iterations right away.
3. Always be dogfooding. Use your own products all the time. Talk to users, help answer support requests, and understand where the painpoints are. Make them your painpoints. Empathize with the people who are getting frustrated with what you built.

## Stuff I've learned about business, company, workflow and making things

1. Optimize communication for greater efficiency and productivity, not for needing more meetings.
2. Optimize company culture for the happiness of your people, because happy people produce their best work, which will make customers happier with the product, and they'll be happy to give you money for it.
3. Hire leaders, not managers. Treat everyone as a self-manager, and create structure for people to lead efforts and initiatives, not manage people.
