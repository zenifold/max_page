Humans are historically bad at disagreeing. There are certainly some exemplary exceptions, but as a race we suck at disagreeing well.

Disagreeing well starts on a foundation of respect. Far too often disagreements really just manifest a deeper issue that has been masked by social niceties: people not respecting each other.
