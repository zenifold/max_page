Conservative vs liberal. Religous vs secular. Democrat vs republican. Gay vs Christian. Pro-choice vs Pro-life.

This is the way we think about issues in our culture. Us versus them. Them versus us.

In our terribly advanced, modern society we have embraced the idea that we should be against each other depending on whether someone agrees with your ideals. And it's a tradgedy of epic proportions.

Recently I read a book written by a gay Christian named Justin Lee titled: "Torn: rescuing the Gospel from the Gay vs Christian debate." Justin used the term "debate" in the title, but could have easily used "war" instead.

Justin's story is one of growing up literally in the middle of a culture war, caught between both sides. As a young person he was raised in a loving Christian home, but as a teenager who realized his identity as a homosexual individual found painful rejection from his own community of believers as he tried to understand and work out his sexuality in light of his commitment to God.

The most gut wrenching part of hearing Justin's story is how people who were likewise commited to God completely overlooked Justin's own genuine commitment and faith because he was revealing something about himself that lived outside of their fixed way of understanding the gay community. To put it simply, most of the Christians in Justin's life belived that all Gay people were diametrically opposed to everything that Christian's stood for because they've bought into the culture wars.
