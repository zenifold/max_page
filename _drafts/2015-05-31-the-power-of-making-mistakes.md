[Brief: Everyone makes mistakes, but we usually cringe when we think of making them. Nobody *likes* to make mistakes, because it's not what we are aiming for. We are aiming for success. However, we need to embrace mistakes as part of the path to and process of finding successful ways of doing things. It's one of the reasons I love GitHub - because GitHub is collaboration software that is built around the idea that making mistakes is a normal and important part of making great software. But a lot of people don't realize how powerful GitHub is for making mistakes, and harnessing mistakes as part of the natural process of making things. So that's what we're going to talk about today.]

Technology can be intimidating. Whether you are my 83-year-old dad trying to understand the complexities of your son's FiOS remote, or whether you are a tech-saavy developer trying to pick up a new language or framework you haven't worked with before: we all experience the fears and frustrations of working with new things.

One of the biggest drivers behind those fears and frustrations is that we as human beings hate to make mistakes. And for good reason. We've learned that mistakes are costly, and can bring lots of pain.

Think about the cost of making a mistake while you're driving on the road. Think about the bost of making a mistake at your job. Think about our ancestors (or even our fellow humans around the world today who live in remote locations) and the cost of making mistakes while living deeply embedded in nature. As a species, we've learned that mistakes can bring great misfortune.

However, we should also realize that mistakes aren't always bad. In fact, mistakes are a critical and important part of learning to do things successfully. 

How many times did you die before you beat Bowser in Super Mario Brothers? How many times did you fall down before you finally learned to ride your bike? How many times did you write your "e" backwards before you learned how to correctly draw the alphabet? How many times did you fail a job interview before you landed a job you really wanted?

Mistakes, and even failure, are a necessary and important part of success. The really important thing then, is not asking how do we avoid mistakes, but how do we give ourselves the freedome to make more mistakes, and to fail faster?

The really scary part of making mistakes is what it can cost you. In some of the more extreme aforementioned examples, the price of error can turn out to be quite great. However, in the creative process of programming (yes, programming is absolutely a creative process), the cost of error is quite nominal in comparrison. Or rather, it can be.

True, if you break code you will likely upset a coworker, user, or even your employer. If you do it often enough and in detrimental enough ways, you might even lose your job. And though your terrible code or awefully designed user experience is pretty unlikely to [kill someone](https://medium.com/@designuxui/how-bad-ux-killed-jenny-ef915419879e), it is actually within the realm of possiblity, no matter how uncommon.

But even the most severe of risks can be mitigated with simple tools at the disposal of every desiger and developer working on the web today. The key here is to accept the fact that we all make mistakes, and we all fail, so the goal is not to avoid making mistakes. The goal is to have an environment where mistakes are okay, and don't bear detrimental consequences.

This is one of the reasons why I love GitHub so much. GitHub (and Git) are tools for doing exactly this. Version control systems are a tool that does exactly what I'm talking about: it removes the risk of trying new things by offering an environment where mistakes are okay to make.

How does it do this? By giving you the ability to roll back your code if stuff goes off the rails (no pun intended); by letting you toy around with new ideas in branches; by giving you a way to get feedback from other people on your changes (pull requests and file diffs).

What this means is that as you work on a project, you have the freedom to focus your creative energy on architecting your solution and exploring new territory, rather than having to split your attention between those creative efforts and the risk-mitigation efforts of making sure you don't break things.
