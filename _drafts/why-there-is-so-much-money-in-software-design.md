# Why there is so much money in software design
### And why anyone can design software

Anyone who has worked in the software industry in the past decade knows that there is plenty of opportunity to make a great living in this industry. Whether you are talking about finding a job with a good salary, or starting a company with opportunity for vast amounts of fiscal growth, the industry is full of opportunity.

And even in the face of a struggling US economy, the technology sector seems to be one of the only sectors actually experiencing growth. But why?

## "Oh I can't do that. You're a computer whiz."

There are of course many factors to why the software and web industry is growing. One of the reasons is simply that industries are still ripe for what the software world has to offer: automation. Turns out there are seemingly endless ways that software can be used to improve processes across all industries.

But the other side to that coin is that computers are still intimidating to a large portion of the population.

Sure, things skew if you look at large urban centers of industry like San Francsisco, New York, L.A. or pretty much any other major city. But as soon as you begin to stretch out into the suburbs and further, you find more and more "digital immigrants" who are slightly (or extremely) intimidated by technology as a whole.

This is what keeps "young, smart guys" like us in business [read also born at the right place and at the right time].

## Scoff it up, baby.

Now at this point many of you reading who fall into my demographic may become slightly defensive.

> Hey, I've worked hard to cultivate these skills that I'm paid so well to use everyday.

Yeah? Good for you. Plenty of other people have worked hard to cultivate the skills that they use everyday too, but are not so lucky to find amazing jobs with wonderful pay and wonderful bennies, or even find jobs at all.
