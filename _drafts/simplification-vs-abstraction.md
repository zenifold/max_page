In software, things are almost always complex. Whether building software, implementing software, or using software as an end user, it's almost always more difficult than anyone would like.

As software designers and engineers, we try to make the process easier on all accounts, and there are many ways to approach the problem depending on what aspect you are addressing.

For example, if using the software is too difficult, we can apply principles of user interface and user experience design to make using it more pleasant. If building the software is too difficult, we implement frameworks to solve common challenges. And if implementing the software is too difficult, we refactor code and create optimizations (like `script/setup`) to ease the pain for implementors.

There are two main ways to think making things easier that I'd like to call out. And while they have the same goal, their approach and outcome are vastly different: simplification vs abstraction.

In short, simplification is an approach where unnecessary elements are removed to make a process or experience simpler, whereas abstraction is the process of keeping complex elements in place but separating them in a way that they can be hidden from plain sight.

Typically, the context of your challenge determines which approach is best.
