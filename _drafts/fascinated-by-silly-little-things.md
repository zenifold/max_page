My little girl is obsessed with my toothbrush. This month. Before that she was obsessed with her Nana’s “umba” (umbrella).

She also has an ongoing, invading obsession with Dora, penguins, and balls of any color or size.

It’s really pretty silly but utterly adorable.

It’s also not a lot unlike her Daddy.

I get caught up in silly little obsessions all the time. Often they last for a day or two (like my recent obsession with LEGO Star Wars sets to buy on eBay), and other times they last for weeks or months (like ... example here).

[write about how the Christian life is about maturing, it's about going somehwere, not staying static; God gives us plenty of things in His amazing universe to be fascinated and captivated by, but they are never inteded for our amazinement and captivation to terminate on themselves; rather they are intended to point us to beyond themselves to Him]
