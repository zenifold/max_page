# Front End Design Conference 2013

## Matt Graham - @michigangraham
### We Should Be Lovers

**GitHub is known for:**

- The Octocat
- Asynchronous Culture
- Creating Git (which is not true - Linus Torvalds created it)
- Drinkups
- *To Make it easier to work together than to work alone)*

**We love community.**

We love doing life together with others. We even love watching others do community together (think Friends, Full House, Cheers)

Community can be fun…but community can suck, too. But actually, it's not that community sucks, it's that we suck at community.

So what does community look like for us as designers and developers?

**Traumatic experiences**

  - Design without Development
  - Development without Deployment
  - 41 Shades of Blue
  …we react to our experiences… ^
  - offended
  - bitter
  - self protective

*If you go through an intersection every day for years, and then one day you get hit by a car going through that intersection. Then everyday after that incident you are going to be affected by that one incident

"I stopped designing for what I thought was best and started designing for, 'what he is going to approve.'"

**Unsucking Community**
  - No one else can make you react any other way than what **you** decide
  - We are the industry craftsman
  - **Know the company vision…and align yourself with it** - you don't have to like it, you don't have to be in agreement with it, but **chose to align** yourself with it;
  - **Get to know your team** - what have they done? what do they do  now? Understand what they are good at? Get to know what they are passionate about. Get to know what drives them to want to **punch coworkers in the face**. *Don't expect they see things or do things the way you do.*
  - **Get to know your projects** you need a *shared understanding* of the project with your team in order to achieve successful results
  - **Document all things** make it easy for people who are new to the project to jump in
  - **Identify challenges** figure out the roadblocks before you start
  - **Expose expectations**
  - **Estimate time and effort**
  - **Divide and conquer**
  - **Be mindful about yourself** What is it that *you* are passionate about? What makes *you* tick? You might not get to do this in the office - it might be something you have to do in your own time; but you need to know what those passions are. What time of day do you work best? Where do you work best? Be aware of your insides ("you can't have the emotion of being frustrated without having a thought coming first. so be aware of what that thought is")
  - **Be aware of your blind spots**…and that you don't know them all.
  - You can't control the company atmosphere, but with mindfulness you can play your part better

  **Unsucking your community**
  - Trust your team
  - *Repent quickly* - when you are wrong, just admit it! "Why are you so afraid of something you've done so often" (walt); "I have not failed, I have just found 1,000 ways that don't work." (Thomas Edison)
  - *Forgive often* - forgiveness is not saying "you weren't wrong." Forgiveness is just saying "I'm not going to hold it against you going forward"; "Avoid attacking people, attack problems." (Tom Preston-Werner)
  - *Relate with your Team* - you don't need to know how to write the code, you need to know how to communicate with the developer who does; be involved with as much of the project as you can (not micromanagement)
  - *Love your ideas, but be willing to change them* - be passionate about your passions, but be flexible with the teams strategy
  - *Don't stop learning* - use the tools at our disposal
  - Community works when you're willing to put your team above self

  **Practical Things To Do This (like at GitHub)**
  - Optimizing for Happiness (link) by Tom
  - Hire For Community
  - Transparent Communication - GitHub has 118 chatrooms, all with search and transparency; cerebra (document everything
  - Pull Request it - even as a designer, you can run a pull request just with screenshots of what you want to do (not even with any code!)
  - Automate Things - Boxen; Hubot; bootstrapping; deployment
  - Ship Early. Ship Often - shipping software is motivational; iteration over perfection
  - Work together. And find people who are passionate about your ideas.
  - Drink beers…(aka relate with each other)…socially. (GitHub destinations)…Mini-summits (core teams spending time away from the office - or together in the office - to focus with each other)

  > The best software is made by happy people working together - Brian

## Michael Parenteau - @parenteau - Creative Director at Relevance
### The Myth of the Half Brained…and their Magic Vacuum

*Solve Problems For People & With People*
  - Software is really all about people.
  - Collaboration - who do we see who we are; how do we identify with ourselves

*Get out of your comfort zone*
  - Learning, growing

*A Story…*
  - 10 years ago, Michael was a pot smoking, nomadic art student. Then he got married and had a kid and realized he needed to make more than $2400 a year. He had a friend who told him about computers, and he was like, "WTF this is like Acronym City!" So he got into using Photoshop, and creating marketing artwork basically. But in 2007, the economy tanked, and he stopped getting business for print, and his clients started to want web content. So he got into designing in Photoshop and using slices and tables to build sites, like most of us use to do….Long story short, Michael got out of his comfort zone and kept getting into things he wasn't comfortable with. In the process he learned lots of new skills and ways of thinking about things, as well as learning how to help customers in new ways

*Pairing is caring*

Michael took a path of generalization; he didn't specialize. But now he works so closely with engineers that it's probably hard to tell he does design work. It's not about being the best at something, it's about being able to work with really cool people, on really cool projects, doing things you really enjoy doing.

If Davinci had listened to his dad when he told him "you are good at sculpting, stick with that", we might never have seen the Mona Lisa.

Programmers are creative too. It takes very creative thinking to engineer solutions the way programmers do, but nobody says "yeah, programmers are very creative people".

Designers use math too. Designers actually apply mathematical concepts of proportion, or physics (with physical mediums), but nobody says, "yeah, designers are such great mathematicians and scientists."

We need both.
> "When process and innovation are balanced, that's really what makes things keep going."

5 Actionable Things:
1. Pair
2. Hold retrospectives. Put things in place for improvement - find out what's working and what's not working
3. Get out of your computer.
4. Set Goals and take time to learn
5. Play. Take time to mess around. Have fun. Experiment.

### Hot Links

Talked about improving your links - because the web is built on links. Duh.

Surprise and delight users with things they didn't expect. Using small touches like easing your hover transitions, rotating things on hover, etc

…*animated gifs rawk*…

Think outside the box with your links and content, like using great animation behaviors on your FAQ pages.

Use audience appropriate hovers.

…hue-rotate contrast - WAT?!!!!! Y I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS BEFORE?!?!?!!!!!
- hovers and readability
- WEBKIT-FILTER ALL TEH THINGS
- don't just define :hover, people, add focus too it!!!!
- what about mobile devices??… just use media queries to detect viewport size?? What about touch devices?! …feature detection with Modernizr?? Prepare for false positives (because Chrome supports touch events…). Use mousemove event and touch start to detect touch devices (thenerdery.com)… (IN OTHER NEWS - why no media query for touch device?!?)

- Be Tom Selik, not Sylvester Stalone. :-P Tom Selik or Burt Reynolds.

## Chris Coyier - @chriscoyier
### CSS is for Computers

**A Brief History of Abstraction**

1s and 0s are just a convention that need an abstraction to allow us to do anything with them.

Symbolic language => Assembler Instructions

Then the internet - link computers together and serve interactive documents that can be linked to each other…which led to browsers.

Browsers contain lots of parts, like rendering engines, javascript engines, etc.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript were all invented for other computers are built to understand.

So, preprocessing is another layer of abstraction to help us. Preprocessors are an abstraction layer that sets on top of CSS. Abstraction is a way to **manage complexity**.

**How Preprocessors Can Help You (Sass Edition)**

.scss => .css => Browser render.
Sass can concatenate and compress into CSS for you.
Global.scss (or "main.scss"). == a table of contents for benefit of concatenation.

"Robot barf crap"…output minified

Variables. Variables are especially useful because of the cognitive load of understand what's going on in your stylesheet.
Nesting.
Mixins. (btw anytime you'd use an @mixin with no parameters, it should probably be an @extend)

**Convincing the Team**

Ol' Grumpy Greg - "I don't like stuff."
You - "But Greg!!!!"

Sass simplifies development and lowers the complexity of our site. While Sass does complicate workflow, it is minor and a one-time cost.

We're always battling to keep things consistent - and Sass is a way to help with that. Sass is much easier to maintain.

**Transitioning to SASS**

It's also great because every .css file is valid .scss, so moving to it can be progressive (low barrier to entry to start receiving the benefits - you pretty much just change your file names and start using the conventions you want to use from Sass).

**Concerns**

Use Codekit. (setup file injection)

Tool barf:
- Livereload
- Assetminify
- Rails
- Grunt
- Guard

**Addressing Misconceptions**

Objection: this is a one way street!! Solution: just export your Sass to regular old CSS

Objection: this is makes bloated css! Solution: YOU made it bloated!!

Objection: Sass is only for really big sites! Solution: While it's true that the benefits of preprocessors scale with the complexity of the project, you still get lots of benefits even on small projects.

Objection: learning new syntax! Solution: It's gonna take you like an hour.

### Serving RWD Styles

**Major Approaches**

1. Single CSS File

- Start with styles applied to all
- Styles scoped to a media query
- styles scoped to another media query

2. Multiple CSS Files

- HTML has global.css and layout.css or similar convention
- Doesn't require a preprocessor
- at least 2 requests

3. Breakpoint Based Partials

- main.css and nomq.css (conditionally linked and contains all the files that were contained in the media queries)
- challenge: maintainability level is higher

4. Module Based Partials

- nomq.css and mq.css based on conditionals in html
- single request
- easy maintenance
- allows you to start with small layouts and serve large layout to old IE without JS
- requires preprocessor
- **forces you to think more modularly**

> The amount of process required is inversely proportional to the skill and experience of your team.

Invest in people over process.

## Doug Neiner - @dougneiner
### jQuery Jumble

An untidy collection or pile of things…

- DOM Manipulation
- Event Delegation
- AJAX
- Deferreds/Promises

1. jQuery & CSS

**jQuery: what & how**
- show() or hide()
  - what - i want my element to be hidden or visible
  - how - show or hide with the display property
- slideUp() or slideDown()
  - what - i want tmy element to be hidden or visible via animation
  - how - show or hide by animating the height property
  - how - i want th animation to last exactly 400ms
- **INSTEAD of ^** use state classes
  - $el.addClass( "is-visible" ); and then use CSS to style accordingly
  - classes can also affect descendent elements
  - editing later is easier by editing the CSS instead of having to edit the JS
  - Allows JS to provide the what, and the CSS to provide the how

**Animation & jQuery**

2. Event Delegation

- Event bubbling allows it to work
- One event on a parent vs. many events on children
- Filtering vs Traversal
- Responsible events - only run on user action
- Can be added before the document is ready
- Forces a contextual approach

…*Look up Doug's Contextual jQuery talks*…

- **Bound events vs Delegated events**
  - Bound
    - Separate handler for each element
    - Executes only

3. jQuery Deferred

- **Traditional Callbacks**
  - Problem:
    - they queue up
    - they look ugly
    -

- **Deferreds**
  - Benefits:
    - Starts in an unresolved state
    - Can either be resolved or rejected with data
    - Once resolved or rejected, it remains forever in that state (promises)
  - $.then
    - Proimises/A spec
    - "Thenable" is the primary API for Deferreds
  - $.when
    - Can have multiple deferrers
  - $.done and $.fail

…**Live coding**…


## Cameron Moll - @cameraonmoll
### Authentic Design

**A brief History**

Born, grew up, made Authentic Jobs. :-) Wanted to be a stuntman. Then wanted to be a film score composer. Then someone told him, "I don't know if this music thing is going to work out for you, Cameron."

Q&A

Q: How Do you Balance Everything?
A: You don't. You prioritize things and then work with those priorities.

Q: How can I make a name for myself (or my product, team, brand etc)?
A: By writing. Write passionately about something you feel qualified to write about. And even if you aren't, write consistently.

Q: How do you manage user experience across multiple devices?
A: Responsive design…but it's not that simple. Check out "Cameron Moll Cross Screen Experience" (slide deck). Focus on the cross screen experience - i.e. what happens when someone starts the process on one device, but wants to continue the process on another device?

Q: Is Photoshop dead?
A: That's the wrong question. What do we need it for? That's the right question. If you can use it effectively,t hen it's a good tool for you.

Q: Flat vs Skeuo
A: Moving on…

Q: Your 2 cents about iOS?
A:
