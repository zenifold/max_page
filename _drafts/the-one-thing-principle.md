Write about how users have a tendency to categorize apps, websites, and services by the one thing they use it for. For example, you use Google for search, LinkedIn for resumes, Facebook for staying in touch with family, Twitter for publicly broadcasting your thoughts, Trello for task management, YouTube for watching videos, GitHub for sharing code, Sublime Text for writing code, etc.

We are a culture of categorizers, even as evidenced by the findings of anthropologists which suggest we are becoming better at remembering where to access information while becoming worse at actually remembering the information. We are data cultivators. So naturally we think of things we use in the context of what we use it for, and for the majority of things we use we create a 1:1 mental map of what the purpose of any given tool or service is for.

With that in mind we should be leveraging that principle in how we design our software, services, and websites. When we understand and can embrace the fact that people think of our app or service in terms of one primary function or source of value to them, we can use that hierarchy to drive the design and consistency of what we are building to create an ultimately better user experience.
