I have a problem: I care a lot about what others think of me. And I don't even know why.

I can speculate about why. There may be some deep, subconscious, Freudian need or motivation to it all. Or it might be a ton of different reasons.

And strangely enough, I claim I don't care what people think. And often I act like I don't care what people think. And a lot of times I **really don't** care what people think.

But deep inside I really do care what people think of me. And I care that they do think of me.

I want to be noticed. I want to be liked. I want to be significant, and relevant. I want to matter to others. And I want to matter to the world.

And I hate it.

I think at least part of why I care what other people think of me is that I hope they will see something in me that I don't see in myself. I want to be validated by others in areas that I lack confidence in my own esteem. Which is again paradoxical because I can be really arogant.
