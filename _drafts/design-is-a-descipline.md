writing points
- didn’t always intend to be a designer
- design is the process of creating order out of chaos
- it’s organization
- it’s applying structure to abstract and loosely related things
- it is very thoughtful
- it is more than just a profession or skillset, it’s a way of living, behaving and seeing the world
