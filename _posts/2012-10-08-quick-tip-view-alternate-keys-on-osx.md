So if you're on a mac, you probably know that you can hit <code>alt + r</code> to get the <code>©</code> symbol directly in your input. Or, that <code>alt + r</code> will get you the <code>®</code> symbol. Or, that <code>alt+8</code> will get you a bullet.

Or maybe you didn't know that. So yeah, pretty cool, huh?

But wouldn't it be great if there was a handy reference to all the special characters you can get with <code>alt +</code> ?

Well, there is on OSX. It's called the Character Viewer. To access it, just follow this path: <code>System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard (tab) > (check) Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar</code>. Then you can click the icon in the menu bar, and select <code>Show Keyboard Viewer</code>. Then, when you press <code>alt</code> on your keyboard, the keys in the Keyboard Viewer will change to the alternates.
