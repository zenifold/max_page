<p class="disclaimer">An open note to my colleagues, family, and friends:</p>

<p>For the past two and a half years, I've had the enormous privilege of being part of <a href="http://cure.org">CURE International</a>, an organization that I've grown to deeply love and respect.</p>

<p>For those that aren't familiar - CURE provides first-world surgical care to impoverished children and families in more than 20 of the world's poorest nations. Through surgical <a href="http://cure.org/hospitals/">hospitals in 10 nations</a>, and clinics and programs in more than 10 other nations, CURE is bringing physical and spiritual healing to literally millions of people around the world.</p>

<p>CURE is a Christian nonprofit organization, and as such is focused on not only bringing physical healing to these children and their families through surgery, but also bringing spiritual healing through the message of God's love.</p>

<p>I started as CURE's very first in-house Web & Graphic Designer in 2009 during a move to bring agency based services under the roof of CURE's home office in Central PA. Last year I assumed the title of Principal Designer, reflecting my role not just in production of graphics and code, but as part of the leadership that develops overall marketing strategy and creative vision for CURE's mass market fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>CURE's mission is deeply intertwined with who I am as a person, as a professional, and as a Christian. I've gotten to be part of some really amazing things at CURE, and built relationships which I can only believe will play out as life long friendships.</p>

<p>And that's why it's with a very bittersweet sentiment that I'm leaving my full time role at CURE to pursue at another wonderful <a href="http://appendto.com/">company</a>. I'm leaving CURE on completely positive terms, solely to pursue what I believe God has for me next.</p>

<p>I'm going to continue to be involved with CURE on a regular basis through volunteer work and possibly contract projects, and will continue to advocate for CURE's mission. I will always have a very special place in my heart for what CURE does, and want to encourage as many of you who read this <a href="http://cure.org/curekids">to get to know CURE better</a>, and get involved.</p>

<p>With excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead,</p>
