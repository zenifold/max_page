## About the Site

This is my personal webpage that is built with Jekyll and SASS and hosted on Netlify. On maxs.page I write about topics that I enjoy, outline projects I am working on, and archive my thoughts and feelings. It's purely personal in nature and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, my family, my community, or anyone else besides me. It's just where I share things I've built, written, or done.

It lives here: [maxs.page](https://maxs.page)
