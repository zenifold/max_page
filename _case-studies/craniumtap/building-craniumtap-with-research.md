## Exploring the possible

As a young entrepreneur, I had always been passionate about market research and the insights it could provide to businesses. So, when I met my future business partner at a networking event, I knew that we had to work together to create something special.

## Bootstrapping the foundation

Together, we founded CraniumTap, a market research firm that focused on providing companies with the data and insights they needed to make better decisions. We knew that we had to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, so we set out to develop proprietary research models and analysis techniques. These innovations gave our clients the decision making ability they needed at any scale.

## Invest, invest, invest

Over the years, we worked tirelessly to refine our models and improve our services. We invested heavily in technology and hired the best and brightest talent to help us grow our business. And, as our reputation for providing high-quality market research services grew, so did our client base. We expanded from working primarily with Technology companies, to Enterprise consulting companies, Healthcare providers, Universities, and Government agencies.

## Turning the flywheel

But we didn't stop there. We continued to push the boundaries of what was possible in market research, developing new and innovative tools and techniques that helped our clients gain even deeper insights into their customers. We also focused on building our brand, establishing ourselves as thought leaders in our local market and positioning CraniumTap as the go-to source for market research solutions.

## Adapting our solution

Through hard work, dedication, and a relentless focus on innovation, we were able to grow CraniumTap into a thriving business. We helped countless companies better understand their customers, and we are proud of the impact that our work has had on the market research industry.

## Sunsetting

Our success did not go unnoticed, and we soon caught the attention of a venture firm that was looking to acquire companies in the market research space. After several months of negotiations, we were able to reach a deal and were acquired in 2021.
