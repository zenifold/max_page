Designers love to redesign things. A redesign is an opportunity to survey something, assess what is wrong, and ask how can it be better? It's a chance to re-imagine, and designers tend to thrive on this process.

Less exciting, however, is making incremental improvements. But often, that is exactly what is needed.

Not every step forward can be a massive leap into the future. Sometimes, due to business goals, or resource constraints, or appropriate timing, the re-imagining process is less of an overhaul and more of an update.

In such instances, most designers will lament the lack of creative freedom that small steps forward typically entail. But mature designers will appreciate and embrace the constraints for what they are: an opportunity to have a profound impact within explicit guide rails.

## Making an impact through healthcare

In 2009 I joined [CURE International](http://cure.org) as the first in-house designer.

CURE runs a network of charitable hospitals and club-foot clinics around the world in resource constrained locations where they treat children with treatable disabilities through western quality medical care.

CURE was founded by a doctor and a nurse who experienced the need for quality medical first hand when they volunteered in Eastern Africa in 1995 and subsequently founded a non-profit organization funded primarily by wealthy donors in their personal network.

Their funding model had proven quite effective at raising enough funds on an annual basis to build and support hospital facilities in 10 nations, and clubfoot and cleft palate treatment clinics in several other nations.

At the time, CURE had managed to serve 1 million patients in it's 13 years in operation, a truly remarkable feat. CURE was having a profound impact in the world – literally changing lives – through healthcare.

## An organization in transition

Despite the brilliant success CURE had achieved through it's large-donor funding model, the organization realized that to reach the next several million patients they would need to scale their fundraising model beyond just a small group of wealthy donors. They would need to tap into the smaller resources of a broader group of support they had yet to meet.

This meant adopting new approaches to fundraising like [leveraging social platforms](#), sponsoring events, and exploring other new avenues of exposure that would introduce CURE to an entirely new audience of donors who may not have the overall giving capacity of CURE's traditional audience, but may have a higher level of personal connection with the mission of the organization and a greater propensity to spread the word along social media channels.

It was time for CURE's approach to fundraising to branch out.

## A brand showing it's seams

With all of the new marketing efforts CURE was undertaking something became quickly apparent: CURE's brand was starting to show it's seams.

The organization's brand presence lacked consistency and felt awkward and out of date along side the branding of other similar NGO's with a worldwide impact like World Vision, Amnesty International, Charity:Water, and others.

The logo itself had already gone through several iterations by various designers, and by the time I joined the organization there were several variations of it in use across everything from print media, video assets, building signage, apparel, and CURE's online presence.

It was clear the organization needed a brand update suited to the discerning eyes of the social media generation. While CURE's traditional donor audience was impressed with anything printed on letterhead, the audience CURE was about to reach could smell lazy brand execution about as well as they could sniff out commercially bagged coffee from an artisinal fresh roast.

## Working within constraints

As an ambitious designer, I was curious what the brand could look like with completely fresh eyes, so I did some explorations with nothing held back.

Design without constraints, however invigorating it may be, is also typically unrealistic. Especially for an established international brand.

I had several key constraints to work with.

### Cost

The number one constraint was cost. Being that CURE is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, and every dollar spent is compared with it's potential to be funding the healing of children around the world, decisions were always made with the bottom line in mind.

For a brand redesign, this pushed us toward a brand update approach that would leverage parts of the existing brand so that if necessary older collateral could remain in circulation as long as possible.

For example, if the logo wasn't too far from the current iteration and kept a similar color palette this meant that older style signage, apparel, business cards, and other print collateral could continue to be used until the stock ran out.

### Direct mail usage

The other key constraint was CURE's large direct mail business. Although the organization was preparing to transition from older methods to new ones, monthly direct mail campaigns were still a significant portion of it's non-major donor giving.

Which meant that any brand redesign would have to be able to accommodate the needs of one or two color printing.

## Executing a re-alignment rather than a re-design

The approach I settled on was to simply update the CURE logo for a modern audience by smoothing out the rough edges, shining a light on the logo's best parts, and envisioning a more complimentary aesthetic for the brand – one that felt more like the audience it was serving (children in the developing world), than the audience it was asking for money from.
