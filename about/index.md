### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Max Murphy. This is my page of the internet. I hope you are able to get a sense of who I am by reading through some of my site.

I'm not big on writing about myself, which is to say I have never been very ego focused. But, I must admit, I have done some pretty cool things in my life. A lot of my life has not been focused on career development so I'm not someone who has worked at a bunch of cool companies, or been a part of trendy startups. Most of my time has been invested into my own personal development through reading, meditation, and most importantly; deliberate solitude. Through silence comes strength, and I have been blessed to have spent so much of my waking time looking at life through an introspective lense. I want this site to be more of a diary or journal, a conversation from my mind to yours. Feel free to follow along, as there is always more to come. 

In 2018 I served as Head of Design at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) where I worked with a small but mighty team of passionate people making websites faster and deployment simpler.

Before joining Netlify, I was a product design lead at [GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-07-introducing-review-requests/) where I worked with several teams over the course of my five years there including: platform & ecosystem, core workflow, design systems, the creative department, new user experience, and user growth.

Prior to GitHub I was a visual design engineer and tech lead at [appendTo](http://appendto.com/), a front-end shop, where I worked on awesome client projects like the [TIME Magazine responsive redesign](/case-studies/appendto/implementing-the-responsive-redesign-of-time-com/).

Prior to that I was principal designer at an amazing nonprofit called [CURE International](http://cure.org/), and I still stay involved with CURE in my free time as a core contributor to the open source project [HospitalRun](http://hospitalrun.io/).

And way back in the day I did freelance graphic and web design full-time for several years.

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn, [speaking](http://github.com/jglovier/speaking) occasionally, and collecting experiences in general. I also enjoy using [side projects](/#projects) to learn new things and to have a creative outlet.

I have a wonderful family and recently moved to the Pacific Northwest (I work remotely for Netlify, as does approximately 50% of the company). Iâ€™m originally from the [Pittsburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh) area (shoutout [Greensburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensburg,_Pennsylvania)), and lived in [Central Pennsylvania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanicsburg,_Pennsylvania) for 10 years.

I'm a [Jesus](http://joelglovier.com/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/) follower because of his message of freedom and [restoration](/writing/brokenness-and-restoration/). Iâ€™m not a very religious person, but my faith is a core part of who I am. My faith in the person and way of Jesus leads me to deeply value and care about things like social justice, human rights, diversity, equality, and loving and respecting every person I come in contact with as fellow members of the human family and as bearers of the divine image within us all.

In my "spare time" I enjoy getting away from the computer screen with other creative outlets like [skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHG2lUYlUs8) & [snowboarding](/post-images/boyceparkrail.jpg), [mural painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUqVSPFgMcw), working on my [project car](https://github.com/jglovier/project-car), making [EDM and house mixes](https://soundcloud.com/joelglovier), [bboying](/post-images/bboy-jag.jpg), [cooking](http://joelglovier.com/writing/food/), rooting for the [Pittsburgh Steelers](http://www.steelers.com/), and other nerdy stuff.

Now that you know so much about me, [you should say hi!](http://twitter.com/home?status=@jglovier%20Hi%20Joel!)
